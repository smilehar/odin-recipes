    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This is a recipe for chicken curry or butter chicken. It is the first indian dish I have ever had the pleasure
        of eating and is one of my overally favorite dishes. It is essentially a chicken stew that features a fantastic spice
        called garam masala. It has a unique flavor that I had never expeirenced with western cooking. 
        It is traditionally served over a bed of rice or with naan.
